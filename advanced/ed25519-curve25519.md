# Ed25519 to X25519 keys conversion

Ed25519 keys can be converted to X25519 keys, so that the same key pair can
be used both for authenticated encryption (`crypto_box`) and for signatures
(`crypto_sign`).

Before considering this operation, please read these relevant paragraphs from the FAQ:

* [Do I need to add a signature to encrypted messages to detect if they have been tampered with?](../quickstart#do-i-need-to-add-a-signature-to-encrypted-messages-to-detect-if-they-have-been-tampered-with)
* [How can I sign and encrypt using the same key pair?](../quickstart#how-can-i-sign-and-encrypt-using-the-same-key-pair)

## Example

```c
unsigned char ed25519_pk[crypto_sign_ed25519_PUBLICKEYBYTES];
unsigned char ed25519_skpk[crypto_sign_ed25519_SECRETKEYBYTES];
unsigned char x25519_pk[crypto_scalarmult_curve25519_BYTES];
unsigned char x25519_sk[crypto_scalarmult_curve25519_BYTES];

crypto_sign_ed25519_keypair(ed25519_pk, ed25519_skpk);

crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519(x25519_pk, ed25519_pk);
crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519(x25519_sk, ed25519_skpk);
```

## Usage

```c
int crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519(unsigned char *x25519_pk,
                                         const unsigned char *ed25519_pk);
```

The `crypto_sign_ed25519_pk_to_curve25519()` function converts an Ed25519 public
key `ed25519_pk` to an X25519 public key and stores it into `x25519_pk`.

```c
int crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519(unsigned char *x25519_sk,
                                         const unsigned char *ed25519_sk);
```

The `crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519()` function converts an Ed25519 secret
key `ed25519_sk` to an X25519 secret key and stores it into `x25519_sk`.

In order to save some CPU cycles, the `crypto_sign_open()` and
`crypto_sign_verify_detached()` functions expect the secret key to be followed
by the public key, as generated by `crypto_sign_keypair()` and
`crypto_sign_seed_keypair()`.

However, the `crypto_sign_ed25519_sk_to_curve25519()` function doesn't have this
requirement, and it is perfectly fine to provide only the Ed25519 secret key to
this function.

## Notes

If you can afford it, using distinct keys for signing and for encryption is
still highly recommended.
